    <p> <b><i><u>Disclaimer</u></i></b> <br> I am an individual trying to integrate payment gateways in my website just
      for learning purposes. Stripe or RazorPay requires us to provide a website with pages such as Terms of Service,
      Privacy Policy, etc.. Thus, I've created this webpage. All the information provided here is true such as my contact
      information. Also, I have intentionally kept the prices low just for learning, testing or exploring purposes. Please
      do not make any
      unintentional payments. It would be an extra work for an explorer like me to get into refunds and all (though I do
      not guarantee any refunds, just a possibility)</p>
